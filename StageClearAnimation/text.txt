-level end animation for msx-wings:
	string STAGE CLEAR zooming out, char by char:
		-5x5 sprites maximized =  160x160 pixels	10x
		-4x4 sprites maximized =  128x128 pixels	8x
		-3x3 sprites maximized =    96x96 pixels	6x
		-5x5 sprites normal size =  80x80 pixels	5x
		-4x4 sprites normal size =  64x64 pixels	4x
		-3x3 sprites normal size =  48x48 pixels	3x
		-2x2 sprites normal size =  32x32 pixels	2x
		-1 sprite normal size    =  16x16 pixels	1x
	after animation, convert to bmp on sc5/11
	total sprites = 25+16+9+4+1 = 55
	size in bytes = 55 * 48 (pattern + colors) = 2640 bytes (it may be loaded ROM -> VRAM in 1 frame at initialization), and easily compressed on ROM
